║         RAILWAY.APP DEPLOYMENT - FINAL CHECKLIST              ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PROJECT PREPARATION STATUS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Dockerfile        → Railway-optimized with volume setup
✅ .railway.toml     → Configured with /app/data mount
✅ .dockerignore     → Optimized for build performance
✅ .env.example      → Complete configuration template
✅ server/index.ts   → 0.0.0.0 binding + health endpoint
✅ Health endpoint   → /api/health for Railway monitoring
✅ Database paths    → Using absolute /app/data paths
✅ Port handling     → Dynamic PORT env var support

BEFORE DEPLOYING TO RAILWAY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [ ] Create amourscanc.com folder
2. [ ] Push to GitHub (don't initialize with README)
3. [ ] Have your admin email ready
4. [ ] Generate a secure password (12+ chars)

RAILWAY DASHBOARD STEPS (In Order):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [ ] New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
2. [ ] Select amourscanc.com
3. [ ] Wait for build to complete
4. [ ] Go to Service Settings → Volumes
5. [ ] Create New Volume:
      - Mount Path: /app/data
      - Size: 2GB
6. [ ] Go to Variables tab, add:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/database.db
      - SESSIONS_PATH=/app/data/sessions.db
      - ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-password
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
7. [ ] Wait for auto-redeployment
8. [ ] Check Deployments status → Success

VERIFICATION (After Deployment):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [ ] Visit https://your-railway-url/api/health
      Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
2. [ ] Visit https://your-railway-url/login
      Expected: Login page loads
3. [ ] Login with your ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD
      Expected: Redirected to dashboard
4. [ ] Try signup with a test account
      Expected: New user created, can login
5. [ ] Check Railway logs for "Server running"
      Expected: No ERROR or ENOENT messages
6. [ ] Redeploy (git push or click redeploy)
      Expected: Previous data persists after redeployment

CRITICAL MUST-HAVES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  Volume mount configured (without this, data is lost)
⚠️  Environment variables all set (incomplete = deploy fails)
⚠️  Health endpoint working (/api/health returns 200)
⚠️  Admin credentials changed from defaults
⚠️  No .db files committed to GitHub

TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK FIXES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Build Fails:          → Check logs, verify Dockerfile syntax
Data Disappears:      → Volume not mounted, see steps above
Login Fails:          → ADMIN_CREDENTIALS wrong or not set
Permission Denied:    → Volume ownership issue (recheck mount)
Out of Space:         → Increase volume size to 5GB
